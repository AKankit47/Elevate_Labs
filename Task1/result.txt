Cybersecurity Internship - Nmap & Wireshark Result
==================================================

üîπ Host: 192.168.1.1 (dxxxxx.xx)
- Status: Host is responsive.
- MAC Address: 54:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Txxxx xx xxxxx) ‚Äì likely a router.
- Open Ports:
  - 80/tcp (HTTP): Router admin panel ‚Äî **unencrypted**, can be vulnerable to MITM.
  - 443/tcp (HTTPS): Secure admin interface ‚Äî ensure certificate validity.
- Closed Ports (445, 631, 49152‚Äì49163): Responded with RST.
  - 445 (SMB): Common target in Windows networks.
  - 631 (IPP): Internet printing ‚Äî safe if unused.
  - 49152+ (dynamic): Common for RPC, UPnP ‚Äî should be monitored.

üîπ Host: 192.168.1.5
- Status: Responsive.
- MAC Address: 22:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown vendor).
- All 1000 TCP ports are **closed**.
- Could be a **laptop, phone, or IoT device** with host-based firewall.

üîπ Host: 192.168.1.8
- Status: Responsive with extremely low latency (likely my own machine).
- All ports are **closed** ‚Äî no visible services.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Insights
-----------------------------------------

| Host IP      | Open Port | Service | Risk Description                                |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 192.168.1.1  | 80/tcp    | HTTP    | Unencrypted login access ‚Äî susceptible to sniffing. |
| 192.168.1.1  | 443/tcp   | HTTPS   | Secure if certificate is valid. |
| 192.168.1.1  | 445‚Äì49163 | Closed  | Good security posture ‚Äî no external access. |
| 192.168.1.5  | None      | -       | Secure ‚Äî all ports closed. |
| 192.168.1.8  | None      | -       | Secure ‚Äî all ports closed. |

üì° Wireshark Analysis
-----------------------------------------

During the Nmap scan, Wireshark captured various types of traffic, including:

üî∏ **ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement Packet**
Example:

Neighbor Advertisement
Target Address: 2401:xxxx:xxxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xx
Destination: 2401:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:x
Flags: Solicited, Override


- This is part of the **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** in IPv6 (like ARP in IPv4).
- The device at `2401:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx` is advertising its availability to `2401:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:x`.
- This usually happens during:
  - System startup
  - Address resolution
  - Network scans (triggered by Nmap)
- No suspicious behavior found; this is **expected IPv6 activity** during scans.

üî∏ **TCP SYN Packets**
- Sent from the scanning host to 1000 common ports on each device.
- If port is open ‚Üí a SYN-ACK is received.
- If closed ‚Üí a RST (reset) is received.
- If filtered (firewall) ‚Üí no response.

No unusual packets, dropped connections, or suspicious payloads were observed.

-----------------------------------------
‚úÖ Conclusion
-----------------------------------------

- Nmap successfully identified 3 active devices on the local network.
- Only the router (192.168.1.1) has open ports, as expected.
- Devices 192.168.1.5 and 192.168.1.8 are well-secured with all ports closed.
- Wireshark confirmed healthy network behavior and protocol use.

üü¢ Final Thoughts:
- Keep router updated and use strong admin passwords.
- Prefer HTTPS over HTTP.
- Disable unused services like UPnP or remote admin.
- Monitor devices that don‚Äôt identify a known vendor.

All activity was conducted on my personal network for learning purposes under proper authorization.
