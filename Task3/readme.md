# 🛡️ Elevate Labs - Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan

## 🎯 Objective
Gain hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- 🐉 **Operating System**: Kali Linux 2025.2
- 🔍 **Vulnerability Scanner**: OpenVAS (Greenbone)

## 🎯 Target
- 🖥️ Localhost (127.0.0.1) and internal IP: 192.168.X.X

## 🧭 Steps Followed
1. ⚙️ Installed and initialized OpenVAS.
2. 🎯 Configured scan target as the host system.
3. 🚀 Executed a full vulnerability scan.
4. 📊 Collected and analyzed the results.

## 🚨 Key Findings
- ❗ Detected outdated packages with known CVEs.
- 🔓 Found open ports with weak service configurations.
- 🛑 Some vulnerabilities scored **Critical** in CVSS.

## 📚 Learnings
- 📈 Gained exposure to CVSS scoring.
- 🧠 Understood risk prioritization based on severity.
- 🛠️ Learned basic mitigation methods (updates, firewalls).

## 🧑‍⚖️ Ethical Note
All scans were performed on systems owned by me with proper authorization.

## 💬 Interview Prep

### ❓ 1. What is vulnerability scanning?
> 🧪 An automated process to identify security flaws in systems or applications.

### ⚔️ 2. Vulnerability scanning vs penetration testing?
> 🔍 Scanning is passive and broad; 🧨 Pen testing is active and deeper with exploitation attempts.

### 🖥️ 3. Common PC vulnerabilities?
> 🐞 Unpatched OS, open ports, weak passwords, outdated software.

### 🧠 4. How are vulnerabilities detected?
> 🔎 By comparing service signatures, CVEs, and configurations against a vulnerability database.

### 📊 5. What is CVSS?
> 📐 Common Vulnerability Scoring System – rates severity from 0 (low) to 10 (critical).

### 🔁 6. How often to scan?
> 📆 Ideally monthly, and after major system changes or patches.

### 🚫 7. What is a false positive?
> ⚠️ When a scan reports a vulnerability that doesn't actually exist.

### ⏱️ 8. How to prioritize vulnerabilities?
> 🧮 Based on CVSS score, exploitability, business impact, and exposure.
