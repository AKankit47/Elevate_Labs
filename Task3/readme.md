# Elevate Labs - Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan

## Objective
To gain hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities using OpenVAS.

## Tools Used
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux 2025.2
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: OpenVAS (Greenbone)

## Target
- Localhost (127.0.0.1) and internal IP: 192.168.X.X

## Steps Followed
1. Installed and initialized OpenVAS.
2. Configured scan target as the host system.
3. Executed a full vulnerability scan.
4. Collected and analyzed the results.

## Key Findings
- Detected outdated packages with known CVEs.
- Found open ports with weak service configurations.
- Some vulnerabilities scored **Critical** in CVSS.

## Screenshots

## Learnings
- Gained exposure to CVSS scoring.
- Understood risk prioritization based on severity.
- Learned basic mitigation methods (updates, firewalls).

## Ethical Note
All scans were performed on systems owned by me with proper authorization.

## Interview Prep

### 1. What is vulnerability scanning?
> It's an automated process to identify security flaws in systems or applications.

### 2. Vulnerability scanning vs penetration testing?
> Scanning is passive and broad; pen testing is active and deeper with exploitation attempts.

### 3. Common PC vulnerabilities?
> Unpatched OS, open ports, weak passwords, outdated software.

### 4. How are vulnerabilities detected?
> By comparing service signatures, CVEs, and configurations against a vulnerability database.

### 5. What is CVSS?
> Common Vulnerability Scoring System – rates severity of vulnerabilities from 0 (low) to 10 (critical).

### 6. How often to scan?
> Ideally monthly, and after major system changes or patches.

### 7. What is a false positive?
> When a scan reports a vulnerability that doesn't actually exist.

### 8. How to prioritize vulnerabilities?
> Based on CVSS score, exploitability, business impact, and exposure.
